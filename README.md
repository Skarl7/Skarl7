## About Me

I'm a UK-based entrepreneur working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and practical business applications. Currently running two companies: **AdnexAI**, where we build AI-powered automation tools for businesses and creatives, and **Lexsk Legal Limited**, a paralegal services firm.

## What I Build

### AdnexAI - AI Tools & Automation
We create intelligent automation solutions for:
- **Marketing & Advertising**: AI-driven campaign tools and content generation
- **Film & Creative Production**: Automated video editing, AI filmmaking tools
- **Social Media**: Content scheduling, automated post generation, multi-platform management
- **Legal Services**: Document automation, client intake systems
- **Consulting Businesses**: Workflow optimization, CRM automation

The goal is simple: take repetitive tasks off your plate so you can focus on what actually matters in your business.

### Lexsk Legal Limited
Paralegal services with a tech-forward approach. We're experimenting with AI to make legal services more accessible and affordable, particularly for small businesses and startups.

## Current Focus Areas

**Legal Tech Innovation**
- Building systems that automate document generation and legal workflows
- Exploring GDPR compliance tools for businesses using AI
- Creating intake and onboarding automation for legal practices

**Business Automation**
- Workflow design and implementation using n8n, OpenAI, and various APIs
- Social media automation for brands and agencies
- Email and notification systems that actually work

**AI Integration**
- Practical applications of GPT-4 and other language models
- Connecting AI tools to existing business software
- Building systems that reduce manual data entry and repetitive tasks

## Featured Projects

### [n8n-workflow-1](https://github.com/Skarl7/n8n-workflow-1)
A collection of automation workflows I've built and use in production:
- YouTube content automation for educational channels
- AI-powered legal document generation
- Complete client onboarding systems
- Social media posting across multiple platforms
- Smart email notification and routing

These aren't theoretical - they're running in actual businesses right now.

### In Development
- **AI Legal Research Platform**: Making case law and regulation research less painful
- **GDPR Compliance Toolkit**: Open-source tools for UK and EU businesses
- **Creative Automation Suite**: Tools for filmmakers and content creators

## Technical Approach

```javascript
const technologies = {
  ai_tools: ['OpenAI GPT-4', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Machine Learning'],
  automation: ['n8n', 'Zapier', 'Custom API Integrations'],
  development: ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'REST APIs', 'Webhooks'],
  platforms: ['Google Workspace', 'Social Media APIs', 'Cloud Functions'],
  legal: ['UK Legal Framework', 'GDPR', 'Legal Drafting', 'Compliance']
};
```

I'm not interested in technology for its own sake. Everything I build needs to solve an actual problem or save someone real time.

## Background

**Business Operations**
- Currently operating two UK-registered companies
- 5+ automation workflows deployed in production environments
- Active R&D in legal automation and AI compliance

**Learning & Development**
- Completed coursework in AI applications for legal services (Coursera)
- Studied GDPR regulation and EU AI Act frameworks
- Ongoing education in automation, AI, and legal technology
- Contributing to open-source legal tech community

**What Drives This Work**

I started building automation tools because I was tired of watching small businesses and legal professionals drown in administrative work. There's so much potential in AI and automation, but most of it feels like it's built for enterprises with massive budgets.

My approach: build practical tools that real businesses can actually use, keep things simple, and focus on solving specific problems rather than chasing trends.
